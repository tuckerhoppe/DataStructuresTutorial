# overview
Trees are like linked lists in that they are a bunch of items with pointers. A tree is made up of nodes pointing to parent nodes and child nodes. If it is the first node in the tree it won't point to a parent. And if it doesn't have any children it will only point to its parent node. A tree uses recursion to traverse the tree.
